New area of audit: Pubsubs


- work with Vu (or Ben Hill) to figure out what these look like (ex. how best to find all subscribers, where to search) 
- Google pubsubs (another internal IPC method—messengers)
- Audit publishers and subscribers (function it’s called from and message it’s publishing, and how many subscribers it has/what it’s subscribing to)
- Look for publish and subscribe methods
