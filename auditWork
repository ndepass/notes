New area of audit: Pubsubs


- work with Vu (or Ben Hill) to figure out what these look like (ex. how best to find all subscribers, where to search) 
- Google pubsubs (another internal IPC method—messengers)
- Audit publishers and subscribers (function it’s called from and message it’s publishing, and how many subscribers it has/what it’s subscribing to)
- Look for publish and subscribe methods


- search each topic in github repos for subscribers' handlers
- handlers for subscribers are usually in service.go (in method: subscriberretry)
- repo lib-pubsub-messages with all topics 

Audit:
- all topics published
- handler methods subscribed to each topic
- methods topics are published in
